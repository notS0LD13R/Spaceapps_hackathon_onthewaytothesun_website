                    The probe successfully performed the first of the seven planned Venus flybys.
                    The Parker Solar Probe mission design employs repeated gravity assists at Venus 
                    to gradually decrease its orbital perihelion to a final altitude of about 8.5 
                    solar radii above the sun. The spacecraft will make seven Venus flybys over the 
                    course of nearly seven years, gradually shrinking its elliptical orbit around the 
                    Sun to a total of 24 orbits.

                    Parker Solar Probe observed the first magnetic switchbacks,
                     they are the sudden reversals in the solar wind's magnetic 
                     field. The NASA-ESA mission Ulysses first observed them, 
                     the first spacecraft to fly over the Sun's poles.
                    The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released 
                    from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona. 
                    This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha 
                    particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV.

                    <p>The first four research papers describing findings from
                        the spacecraft's first two dives near the Sun were published.
                        They reported the direction and strength of the Sun's magnetic field,
                        as well as the unusually frequent and brief changes in the Sun's
                        magnetic field's direction.
                        These findings support the hypothesis that Alfvén waves are the 
                        most promising candidates for understanding the mechanisms underlying
